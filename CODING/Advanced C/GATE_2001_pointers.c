[PI] int * g (void) 
{ 
  int x= 10; 
  return (&x); 
}  
   
[P2] int * g (void) 
{ 
  int * px; 
  *px= 10; 
  return px; 
} 
   
[P3] int *g (void) 
{ 
  int *px; 
  px = (int *) malloc (sizeof(int)); 
  *px= 10; 
  return px; 
}

Which of the above three functions are likely to cause problems with pointers?

/*
 In P1, pointer variable x is a local variable to g(), and g() returns pointer to this variable.
 x may vanish after g() has returned as x exists on stack. So, &x may become invalid. 
In P2, pointer variable px is being assigned a value without allocating memory to it. P3 works perfectly fine. 
Memory is allocated to pointer variable px using malloc(). So, px exists on heap, itâ€™s existence will remain in memory even after return of g() as it is on heap.
