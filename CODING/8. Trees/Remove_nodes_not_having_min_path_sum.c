/** 
  * Given a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf.
  * The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path.
  * Given a number K, you have to remove (prune the tree) all nodes which donâ€™t lie in any path with sum>=k.
  *
  * Note: A node can be part of multiple paths. So we have to delete it only in case when all paths from it have sum less than K.
