When we allocate a local variable, it goes into stack. Similarly dynamic allocation cause the variable to go on heap. Now, my question is, is this variable actually lie on stack or heap or we will just a reference in the stack and Heap.

For example,

Suppose I declare a variable int i. Now this i is allocated on the stack. So, when I print the address of i, this will be one of the location on stack.
